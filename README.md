# Flask Snake

A simple snake game served with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). The game is rendered on an HTML canvas and controlled with the arrow keys. The snake features rounded segments and eyes for a more lifelike look and apples replace the old pellets. Movement is tuned for a smoother, more balanced pace.

## Running locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to play.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to move the snake. Eat the apples to grow. Avoid running into yourself!
